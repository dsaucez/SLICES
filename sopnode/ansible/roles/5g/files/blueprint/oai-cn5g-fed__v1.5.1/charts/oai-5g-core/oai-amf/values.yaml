kubernetesType: Vanilla  #Vanilla for community kubernetes distribution else Openshift for Openshift

## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images
## To know more about them follow this tutorial https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/tree/master/openshift
nfimage:  # image name either locally present or in a public/private repository
  repository: docker.io/oaisoftwarealliance/oai-amf           ## The image will be pulled from dockerhub
  version: develop                                   #image tag, develop tag for experimental features 
  # pullPolicy: IfNotPresent or Never or Always
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

## good to use when pulling images from docker-hub mention 
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: "regcred"

serviceAccount:
  # Specifies whether a service account should be created
  create: true
  # Annotations to add to the service account
  annotations: {}
  name: "oai-amf-sa"

#service type is fixed to clusterIP, it is only support for non multus interface (eth0)
podSecurityContext:
  runAsUser: 0
  runAsGroup: 0

# AMF needs two seperate interface one for http (for SBI) and other one for SCTP (N1/N2) to communicate with gNB. 
# But for experimentation only one interface can be used. 
# When you need multus:
# 1. you want seperate interface for N1/N2 and Namf 
# 2. Your gnB is outside the cluster and the host machine can communicate but pods can not then you can provide ip-address in the same range as your host machine
# 3. You want static ip-address for N1/N2 interface, Namf can be discovered by its service name

## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
multus:
  ## If you don't want to add a default route in your pod then leave this field empty
  defaultGateway: #"172.21.7.254"
  n2Interface:
    create: true 
    Ipadd: "172.22.10.94"
    Netmask: "24"
    ## If you do not have a gateway leave the field empty
    Gateway:
    ## If you do not want to add any routes in your pod then leave this field empty
    routes: [{'dst': '10.8.0.0/24','gw': '172.22.10.1'}]
    hostInterface: "ran0" # Interface of the host machine on which this pod will be scheduled

## Incase the pod is not able to resolve the FQDN of other network 
## functions example nrf then you can disable useFqdnDns feature this way AMF will talk to other network functions using their ip-address.
